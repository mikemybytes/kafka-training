# Exercise 4 - Kafka Streams

1. Import & build [streams-word-count](../streams-word-count) project. It contains a variation of the famous
   [word count](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) example built using Kafka Streams.
2. Run the application.
3. Take a look at the [WordCountTopology class](../streams-word-count/src/main/java/com/mikemybytes/kafka/streams/WordCountTopology.java).
   Try to understand how it works.
4. While keeping the application running, send some data to the `text_lines` topic:
    ```bash
    kcat -b localhost:9092 -P -t text_lines -K: << EOF
    1:this is just a test
    2:this is yet another one
    3:such a great test
    4:i like this test
    5:it's test
    EOF
   ```
5. Check application's logs. What do you see?
6. Send another batch of messages into the topic:
    ```bash
    kcat -b localhost:9092 -P -t text_lines -K: << EOF
    6:what about another test
    7:it's a test too
    EOF
   ```
7. Check what topics are available now:
    ```bash
    kcat -b localhost:9092 -L
    ```
   Try to figure out from where they come from.
