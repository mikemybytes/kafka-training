# Exercise 3 - JSON and error handling

## Part 1 - JSON support

1. Import & build [order-processing](../order-processing) and [shopping-cart](../shopping-cart) projects.
   Shopping cart will be producing events representing orders to be processed.
   ```mermaid
        flowchart TD
            shopping-cart -- sends ordered cart to --> order-processing 
    ```
2. Run both applications. Every 20 seconds you should observe new `CardOrderedEvent` coming to the `order-procesing` 
   service. Locate the logic responsible for that.
3. Examine messages from the `cart_orders` topic using `kcat`:
   ```bash
   kcat -b localhost:9092 -C -f '\nKey (%K bytes): %k\t\nHeaders: %h\t\nValue (%S bytes): %s\n\Partition: %p\tOffset: %o\n--\n' -t cart_orders 
   ```
   Pay special attention to the `__TypeId__` header. Try to find out where it comes from.
4. What's the partitioning scheme?

## Part 2 - Error handling

1. Keep `order-processing` app running, but stop `shopping-cart`.
2. It's time to break something! Let's send a non-JSON event to the `cart_orders` topic:
   ```bash
   kcat -b localhost:9092 -P -t cart_orders -K: << EOF
   wrong:not a json
   EOF
   ```
3. What happened to the application? Try restarting it.
4. Stop the application.
5. Navigate to [KafkaConfiguration class](../order-processing/src/main/java/com/mikemybytes/kafka/orderprocessing/KafkaConfiguration.java)
   and uncomment the configuration code. Start `order-processing` application again. What has changed?
6. List topics available in the broker:
   ```bash
   kcat -b localhost:9092 -L
   ```
   You should find a new topic called `cart_orders.DLT`. Check what's inside:
   ```bash
   kcat -b localhost:9092 -C -f '\nKey (%K bytes): %k\t\nHeaders: %h\t\nValue (%S bytes): %s\n\Partition: %p\tOffset: %o\n--\n' -t cart_orders.DLT
   ```
